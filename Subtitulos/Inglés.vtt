if you want my fish you will have to fight for it get ready to fight !!!

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:51.040
what? why not? Or if you didn't know, my body is...

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:16.180
Look at me, I'm a human like you. It's serious, I swear. Look at me. Stay there. And don't move.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:34.460
You're also human, right? Of course I am. There's something that makes you different. You look very fragile, as if you were going to break with something. It's because I'm a girl. A girl?

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:47.600
Are you serious? Have you never seen a girl, a woman? No, besides the grandfather, you're the first human being I've met. I'm telling you the truth.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:59.720
The grandfather told me that if I ever met a girl, I should be very kind to her. How cute, see? You cut it, don't take it off, brave. And do you live with your grandfather? No, he died.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:12.280
So women don't have tails? I do, and it's very cute, don't you think? Yes. I'm proud of her. What a strange boy.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:23.520
Hey, did you catch the noisy monster? It's not a noisy monster, it's a car. In the city we have many. It's true, the grandfather told me about them.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:37.840
And you're a very strong boy, right? Yes, the grandfather made me run and lift heavy rocks. Hey, tell me something. If you come in a car, it means you're from the city, right? Yes.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:50.190
Because with you. What did you say? I didn't say anything.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:57.130
I'm just a girl, I don't have a car. You don't have a car, car... I'll give you a reason. I'll give you a reason. What did I say?

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:10.130
You said that you didn't come from the city. I don't have a car.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:15.670
And she gave you a reason. Do you want to drive? She doesn't know how to drive. She has to drive. You're a girl. Ha-ha-ha.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:49.230
Yes, my grandfather gave it to me before I died and no one can touch it, not even a... Oh, Goku. See?

00:08:49.730 --> 00:09:01.770
What? That's impossible, two grandfathers, they're your two grandfathers. They're not grandfathers, they're dragon spheres. Dragon spheres? I found them exactly in the basement of my house.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:07.130
I didn't know what they were, so I asked everywhere until someone told me they were magic spheres.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:22.030
They are found in different parts of the world, but when they are all together, the great dragon god appears.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:35.370
Then the magic words are said and the god grants the wish that one wants to ask. This will help. It's my radar, dragon, I built it.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:45.810
What do you think? Look, these three are the spheres we have. Yes. And here are the others. The closest one is to the southwest. I don't understand.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:57.810
It doesn't matter, but we can't get there walking and since you destroyed my car, we need to do something about it. Look at this. What was it? Number nine? I think so.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.630
Don't get close, everything will be fine. Don't move. Don't move.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:19.120
It was a stupid thing, it was a Hopo capsule and in the city where I live, everyone uses it and they have motorcycles like this.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:28.280
Listen, it's not magic. So come on, get in. Do you want? If you say so. Hold on, there.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:44.460
Your wish is granted.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:11:04.820
I think something is going on. Stop screaming, creature.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:12.100
Are you afraid of heights? Tell me that.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:30.130
Maybe they are not friends. Hey. And now what do I do? How will I rescue her if I don't know how to fly? I know!

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:37.520
But to be able to do it, I don't think she did something like that.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:12:04.600
Let yourself go! No!

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.480
Goh-Hui!

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:17.720
Yes!

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:55.790
Goh-Hui and Bulma follow their journey in search of the Dragon Balls. They are the legendary Balls that, once gathered, can fulfill any desire.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:08.330
So all we need is to get the other four Balls? Calm down, Goku. These stupid things aren't that easy. Maybe you don't realize it because you've never been out of your mountains.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:22.190
Well, it's getting dark. We can stay here. I think we'll first set up camp and then have dinner. A girl as decent as me can't sleep in the dark.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:33.710
So what do we do? There's no house in this place. Don't forget my capsules. I'll use one of my capsules to build the house. Please, move away a little.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:58.970
You're so silly, Goku.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:10.950
Are you going to sleep outside? Don't tell me you don't know electricity. This is incredible.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:22.790
What kind of world have you lived in? Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:43.100
You smell horrible. What? What is bathing? Oh, this is incredible. You don't know how to bathe?

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:53.140
I think I understand now. Come on, come on. Come on, I'll wash you, so hurry up and come.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.740
Is this the bath? You!

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:18.090
This is a weird wash. Shut up. There is no better way to wash a little girl in the bath than this. Turn your back.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:31.860
Do you put the accessory directly on your back? What's wrong with you? Why do you have this useless tail? I'll clean your back better.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:41.700
Hey, that hurts. Do you see it?

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:55.240
Your tail is moving. Are you surprised? My tail. Yes, it's moving.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:10.360
I see, you don't have a tail. Men have tails. No, it's just that... I never thought there was something like this. It's really strange.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:23.360
I thought it was useless, but now I think maybe they are a little useful. But a dead little girl is a man, but she doesn't have a tail. That's right, right? Hey, hey. You don't usually have a tail, right?

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:33.120
Don't feel bad. You are mysterious. I better go to the bathroom.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:42.800
He thinks I'm a magician, but he's the one who has a magic tail. Wow, he's a very strange boy.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:58.920
Don't scare me like you do.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.460
It's not exactly the same. You are a boy and I am a girl. And what?

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:30.990
All I want is to be left alone.

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:46.250
Is this food? This thing you call bread has little holes and it doesn't taste like anything. Besides, the soup is bitter. It's coffee.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:57.890
Don't be silly and eat this. That's why you don't grow. Come on, eat. I'll get real food that does help you grow. And now what are you going to do?

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:07.660
Wait a minute. You can be alone and I'll make you food. See you. Wow, you're strange. I don't understand you.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:22.920
That was good yesterday. Now. I got a centipede and a wolf. Let's roast them. Do you think?

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:27.990
Oh.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.880
Look, there's the wolf. Where's the wolf?

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:56.350
I don't like sharing my bed.

00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:08.790
I'll lend you a blanket so you can sleep on the floor. I'll sleep on the floor? Of course. I already told you that I like to sleep alone. Now get out of there and sleep. Strong and brave man. It's because you're embarrassed not to have a tail.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:21.060
I don't care if you're like that. I don't care about tails. Get out of here. Oh, you're crazy. You said you lived only with your grandfather, right?

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:30.460
Do you have a father and you're an orphan? Actually, I don't know. I appeared alone in the woods. When I was a baby, my grandfather found me and took me with him home. I think he loved it.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:44.680
Surely he was abandoned for his tail. Poor thing. You have a very nice tail and I'm glad you were happy with your grandfather. Yes, I also like my tail and you like me even if you don't have a tail. I don't want a tail. Leave me alone.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.520
I don't like people who fall asleep while talking.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:15.940
Gracia, come to me. Conquest. I love you. Un misterio vas a descubrir

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:27.660
Todos quieren pronto vivir Aventuras, mil y algo más Juventud, conserva la inocencia que hay en ti

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:40.180
Si tratas de aparentar algo que no eres Se estimará la magia igual que la maldición

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:52.500
Atrévete a enfrentar Salvaje y plenamente El milagro de vivir

00:20:53.820 --> 00:21:05.960
Romance te puedo dar Romance te puedo dar Si me enseñas con valor la verdad que hay en ti

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:16.080
Romance te puedo dar Romance te puedo dar Romance te puedo dar Gritando en mi pecho está

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.420
Vigorosamente la muerte alienita
